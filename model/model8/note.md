model 7 was okay, still had some problem like having to wait holding the gestuer position for it to recognize, also don't know if more gesture would mess with it... 
that is what this model will do
- more gestures
- feature engineer? maybe, atleast the easy ones like velocity and such






training vs val acc 
training acc > val acc = overfitting 

training loss vs val loss
loss < val loss - model too simple/high regularization 
loss = val loss - generalizes well


dense
- sigmoid: binary 
- softmax: multi class 
- linear/relu: regression
