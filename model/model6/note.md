Hello readers


currently model5 is the best model that I have created - if we were to release this, this will be the release canidate.
model6 will be testing out other models and improving the training data


Summary
- Initial Data Cleaning: Before splitting.
- Data Splitting: Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Feature Extraction: After splitting the data.
- Preprocessing (e.g., Scaling): After splitting the data.
- Feature Selection: After splitting the data and preprocessing.





current problem (june 30th, 2024) working on the test script, camers_test.ipynb, having trouble with the actual model testing to see if a new inputted gesture can be 
recognized. Pretty sure it has something to do with how the scaler is being applied
