# 🎓 Capstone Machine Learning Training Repository

This repository contains the training workflows, model experimentation, and code artifacts developed during my machine learning capstone project. It represents the culmination of practical ML techniques explored through iterative experimentation and learning.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `data/`: Preprocessing scripts and datasets used during training
- `model/`: Trained model checkpoints and performance metrics
- `website/`: Deployment front-end Test
- `pyvenv.cfg`: Python virtual environment configuration
- `.gitignore`: Keeps clutter out of version control

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

Throughout this project, I aimed to:

- Understand and implement core ML concepts using TensorFlow and NumPy
- Develop pipelines for training, evaluating, and tuning models
- Explore supervised learning tasks like classification and regression
- Integrate model performance insights into a presentable format

## 🚀 Key Features

- Modular and reproducible training scripts
- Flexible architecture for testing multiple models
- Visualization tools for tracking training progress
- Clean and readable codebase to support future extension

## 📊 Results & Insights

This project helped solidify my understanding of how machine learning models are developed, optimized, and evaluated. Hands-on experimentation with real-world datasets provided a strong foundation in practical ML deployment workflows.
